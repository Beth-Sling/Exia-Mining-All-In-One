This is a complex mining script meant to be run on the RuneMate client.
I excluded the actual mining logic from this repository since that is 
proprietary and I do plan to sell it in the future.

There are some great examples of locations and the way their data is formatted
in the locations directory. So long as the proper heirarchy is observed, any 
location can be used with the script mining logic.

With this in mind, feel free to fork and add your own locations and I'll 
pull them into the main branch and put them on BotStore for you to use.

Addtionally, if you don't like the way that my logic works, feel free
to implement your own version of the PowerMiner or StandardMiner class and
insert them to take advantage of the data that I've collected.
