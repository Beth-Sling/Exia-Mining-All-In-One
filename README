This is a relatively complex mining script meant to be run on the [RuneMate](runemate.com/community) client.

I've now included my mining logic since I no longer have plans to sell it at the moment. Fork and change away!

There are some great examples of locations and the way their data is formatted
in the locations directory. So long as the proper heirarchy is observed, any 
location can be used with the script mining logic.

With this in mind, feel free to fork and add your own locations and I'll 
pull them into the main branch and put them on BotStore for you to use.

Addtionally, if you don't like the way that my logic works, feel free
to implement your own version of the PowerMiner or StandardMiner class and
insert them to take advantage of the data that I've collected.

My one licence agreement:
1. Any modifications that are posted to Runemate MUST be added to Github via a fork of this repository.
